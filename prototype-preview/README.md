# Prototype preview

A lightweight prototype preview for experimenting with visual styles before turning them into production themes. Open `index.html` directly or serve the `prototype-preview/` directory with any static file server to explore the available prototype styles.

## Usage
1. Open the gallery in your browser: `http://localhost:3000/prototype-preview/` (or the equivalent local file path).
2. Pick a style from the dropdown to apply it immediately.
3. To deep-link to a specific prototype, append `?theme=<prototype-id>` — for example: `http://localhost:3000/prototype-preview/?theme=retro-grid`.

The preview automatically updates the query string when you change selections, so you can copy/paste the URL to share a specific prototype state.
